# CHAOSS Microtasks

This repository contains the microtask submissions for CHAOSS GSoC 2020. I want to work on the idea:
**[Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Open Source Communities](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/545)**.

- [X] **Microtask 0:** Familiarize yourself with augur by downloading and configuring the dev branch. For a little more context about what we are trying to accomplish with Augur's prototyping, checkout Augur's documentation at : https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/ Fork Augur into your own GitHub Account. Work in the dev branch.

- [X] **Microtask 1:** Using any machine learning algorithm or library you are comfortable experimenting with, identify data anomalies in the commits, pull_requests, issues, or "messages" tables. The database structure is in the documentation noted above. You would choose "messages" if you have a particular interest in computational linguistics oriented machine learning. You do not need to build your analysis as a worker.

Worked in dev branch and added a notebook to analyze anomalies in the messages table, then provided visualizations of the same.
- [X] **Microtask 2:** Make a pull request to update the dev branch with the work from Microtask 1. If you have questions about getting started in the steps above, open an issue in the Augur repository.

## About me  
- My name is **P Akshara**. I am in my **second year pursuing Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Information Technology** at
**National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal in India.**
- I developed interest in programming when I got the **opprtunity to spend a summer under the [Technovation WeTech program](https://www.iie.org/programs/wetech) in class 8.** Here I was mentored by **experts from Qualcomm**, who guided us in making an App and a business solution to market it.
- I have been programming in **C++/Python since 3 years** and have done some projects as well. I am **familiar with Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Keras and have a basic knowledge of Flask** as well.
- In my college, I am a part of **2 technical communities, [IEEE Computer Society](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/index.html) and [IRIS](https://iris.nitk.ac.in/hrms/pages/about)**. In IEEE, I'm a part of the Intelligence society and in IRIS, I am a part of the **web development team, working on Ruby on Rails stack.**
